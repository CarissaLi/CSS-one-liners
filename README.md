# CSS One-Liners

Having followed some projects over time, I discovered there were CSS properties that could have saved us from writing longer lines of CSS.

Being a beginner advocate of DRY code, I try my possible best to keep my codes short, simple and clean. That was what brought about this open source project.

I know there are so many CSS one-liners out there and I'd love to have them in one repo for everyone to have access to.

Your contribution will be highly appreciated.
